# Bochi-the-Rock-Themed-Website

It's my uni project on free to take theme. I've chosen like a main theme anime "Bochi the Rock". So it's basically bochi the rock themed site about it(and kessouku band).
There is no responsive design in it. In this project i combined html/css with a little bit of js.
Also in the end of website there is implemitation of form backend api from Formspree.
